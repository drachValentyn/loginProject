Training project on JS.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Webpack] - the streaming build system

### Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:9009
```
